This book is a hands-on guide to building practical, intelligent AI agents and agentic systems using the official OpenAI Agents SDK. Designed for readers with beginner to intermediate technical backgrounds, this book introduces the core concepts, design principles, and architecture of AI agents in a clear, structured way.

You will first start by grounding yourself in the core concepts of AI agents, how they differ from other traditional systems, and their advantages. You will then learn about all the features of OpenAI Agents SDK by implementing it to build real-world, practical AI agents. These include tools, memory, RAG, multi-agent orchestration, tracing, handoffs, and more. Each chapter deepens your skills while contributing to a growing, end-to-end agent project.

Each chapter builds upon a continuous project that evolves in complexity, giving you immediate, applied experience as you progress. These include a custom support AI agent, an invoice processing and inventory management AI agent, a health advisor AI agent, a sales trainer AI agent, a data analyst AI agent, and so on. From building your first agent to deploying multi-agent systems integrated with external APIs and databases, you'll develop the confidence and skills to bring agentic AI into production
